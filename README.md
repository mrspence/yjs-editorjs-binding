# Editorjs binding for yjs

> THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS: I'm currently exploring the idea; below is the vision, time will tell ðŸ˜‰ - Matt

## Why?

Looking to utilise collaboration in a product that uses Editor JS. [hughfenghen/y-editorjs](https://github.com/hughfenghen/y-editorjs) is a fantastic starting point but needs a little more love that likely includes breaking changes. Mad credit to [hughfenghen](https://github.com/hughfenghen) for getting this on the road.

Open to merging back to [hughfenghen/y-editorjs](https://github.com/hughfenghen/y-editorjs) if/when this repo is ready.


## How to run

1. Clone this repo
2. `pnpm i`
3. `pnpm run dev` and `pnpm run ws`
4. Open http://localhost:8080 in two browser tabs and play


## Current plan

- Release a stable solution for Editor JS binding.
- Encourage pull requests to continue the development of this yJS Editor Binding.


## Community

Pull requests and issues are highly encouraged and will be responded to rather quickly.

Like any Open Source project; this doesn't pay the bills! Consideration of that is expected in all community comms. We're in this together. ðŸ”¥
